Social Engineering:
A manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private information, access, or valuables.

 Stages of social engineering:
 1.Prepare

 2.Establish trust

 3.Use persuasion tactics

 4.Disconnect from the target

 Signs of an attack:
 Oftentimes, people are unable to tell that an attack is happening until it's too late. Social engineering is such a dangerous 
 threat because it typically allows attackers to bypass technological defenses that are in their way. Although these threats are 
 difficult to prevent, recognizing the signs of social engineering is a key to reducing the likelihood of a successful attack.

 These are common types of social engineering to watch out for:

 ->Baiting is a social engineering tactic that tempts people into compromising their security. A common example is USB baiting that 
   relies on someone finding an infected USB drive and plugging it into their device.

 ->Phishing is the use of digital communications to trick people into revealing sensitive data or deploying malicious software. It 
   is one of the most common forms of social engineering, typically performed via email.

 ->Quid pro quo is a type of baiting used to trick someone into believing that they’ll be rewarded in return for sharing access, 
   information, or money. For example, an attacker might impersonate a loan officer at a bank and call customers offering them a 
   lower interest rate on their credit card. They'll tell the customers that they simply need to provide their account details to 
   claim the deal.

 ->Tailgating is a social engineering tactic in which unauthorized people follow an authorized person into a restricted area. This 
   technique is also sometimes referred to as piggybacking.

 ->Watering hole is a type of attack when a threat actor compromises a website frequently visited by a specific group of users. 
   Oftentimes, these watering hole sites are infected with malicious software. An example is the Holy Water attack of 2020 that 
   infected various religious, charity, and volunteer websites.

 Encouraging caution"
 Spreading awareness usually starts with comprehensive security training. When it comes to social engineering, there are three main 
 areas to focus on when teaching others:

 ->Stay alert of suspicious communications and unknown people, especially when it comes to email. For example, look out for 
   spelling errors and double-check the sender's name and email address.

 ->Be cautious about sharing information, especially over social media. Threat actors often search these platforms for any 
   information they can use to their advantage.

 ->Control curiosity when something seems too good to be true. This can include wanting to click on attachments or links in emails 
   and advertisements.

 Pro tip: Implementing technologies like firewalls, multi-factor authentication (MFA), block lists, email filtering, and others 
 helps layers the defenses should someone make a mistake.

Phishing:
The use of digital communications to trick people into revealing sensitive data or deploying malicious software.

 Types of Phishing:

 ->Email phishing is a type of attack sent via email in which threat actors send messages pretending to be a trusted person or 
   entity.

 ->Smishing is a type of phishing that uses Short Message Service (SMS), a technology that powers text messaging. Smishing covers 
   all forms of text messaging services, including Apple’s iMessages, WhatsApp, and other chat mediums on phones.

 ->Vishing refers to the use of voice calls or voice messages to trick targets into providing personal information over the phone.

 ->Spear phishing is a subset of email phishing in which specific people are purposefully targeted, such as the accountants of a 
   small business.

 ->Whaling refers to a category of spear phishing attempts that are aimed at high-ranking executives in an organization.

Malware:
Software designed to harm devices or netweorks.

 Types of Malware:

 ->Virus: Malicious code written to interfere with computer operations and cause damage to data and software.

 ->Worm: Malware that can duplicate and spread itself across systems on it's own.

 ->Trojan: Malware that looks like a legitimate file or program.

 ->Ransomware: Type of malicious attack where attackers encrypt an organization's data and demand payment to restore access.

 ->Spyware: Malware that's used to gather and sell information without consent.
