Detection:
Detection refers to the prompt discovery of security events.

 Methods of detection:
 
 Threat Hunter: Threat hunting is the proactive search for threats on a network. Security professionals use threat hunting to 
 uncover malicious activity that was not identified by detection tools and as a way to do further analysis on detections. Threat 
 hunting is also used to detect threats before they cause damage. For example, fileless malware is difficult for detection tools to 
 identify. It’s a form of malware that uses sophisticated evasion techniques such as hiding in memory instead of using files or 
 applications, allowing it to bypass traditional methods of detection like signature analysis. With threat hunting, the combination 
 of active human analysis and technology is used to identify threats like fileless malware. 

 Threat intelligence:
 Organizations can improve their detection capabilities by staying updated on the evolving threat landscape and understanding the 
 relationship between their environment and malicious actors. One way to understand threats is by using threat intelligence, which 
 is evidence-based threat information that provides context about existing or emerging threats. 

 Threat intelligence can come from private or public sources like:

 ->Industry reports: These often include details about attacker's tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP).

 ->Government advisories: Similar to industry reports, government advisories include details about attackers' TTP. 

 ->Threat data feeds: Threat data feeds provide a stream of threat-related data that can be used to help protect against 
   sophisticated attackers like advanced persistent threats (APTs). APTs are instances when a threat actor maintains unauthorized 
   access to a system for an extended period of time. The data is usually a list of indicators like IP addresses, domains, and file 
   hashes.

 It can be difficult for organizations to efficiently manage large volumes of threat intelligence. Organizations can leverage a 
 threat intelligence platform (TIP) which is an application that collects, centralizes, and analyzes threat intelligence from 
 different sources. TIPs provide a centralized platform for organizations to identify and prioritize relevant threats and improve 
 their security posture. 

 Note: Threat intelligence data feeds are best used to add context to detections. They should not drive detections completely and 
 should be assessed before applied to an organization.

 Cyber deception:
 Cyber deception involves techniques that deliberately deceive malicious actors with the goal of increasing detection and improving 
 defensive strategies. Honeypots are an example of an active cyber defense mechanism that uses deception technology. Honeypots are 
 systems or resources that are created as decoys vulnerable to attacks with the purpose of attracting potential intruders. For 
 example, having a fake file labeled Client Credit Card Information - 2022 can be used to capture the activity of malicious actors 
 by tricking them into accessing the file because it appears to be legitimate. Once a malicious actor tries to access this file, 
 security teams are alerted.
 
Automation for Finding Threats (CI/CD):
CI/CD pipelines help you release software faster, but they can also open up new vulnerabilities for attackers. If someone breaks 
into your pipeline, they could add code, steal private information, or stop your software from working. So, ongoing monitoring that 
automatically finds unusual pipeline activity is critical. Effective CI/CD monitoring uses automation to do more than just collect 
logs. It uses monitoring tools to automatically find unusual things happening in build processes, code, or deployment steps that 
may indicate potential security threats. When these threats are found, security teams can respond quickly and limit the damage. 
This automated threat detection is a main goal of strong CI/CD security.

 Common Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) in CI/CD Pipelines:

 ->Unauthorized Code Changes:

  -->Code changes from people who shouldn't be making changes.

  -->Code changes made at unusual times or from unexpected locations.

  -->Code changes that look suspicious, like confusing code, very large deletions without a good reason, or code that doesn't follow 
     coding rules.

 ->Suspicious Deployment Patterns:

  -->Deployments to unusual or unapproved systems (for example, production deployments started directly from developer branches).

  -->Deployments happening at unexpected times or too often (deployments outside of planned release times).

  -->Deployments started by unusual user accounts or automated accounts that shouldn't be releasing to production.

 ->Compromised Dependencies:

  -->Finding known vulnerabilities (CVEs) in dependencies during automated checks in the CI/CD pipeline.

  -->Suddenly adding new, unexpected dependencies to build settings.

  -->Attempts to download dependencies from unofficial or untrusted sources.

 ->Unusual Pipeline Execution:

  -->Pipeline steps that normally work fine suddenly failing.

  -->Pipelines takeing much longer to run for no clear reason.

  -->Changes in the order or way pipeline steps run without approved changes being made.

 ->Secrets Exposure Attempts:

  -->Logs showing attempts to get to secrets from unapproved places in the pipeline.

  -->Finding private secrets hardcoded in code changes (ideally prevented earlier, but monitoring can catch mistakes).

 Proactive Security Through Monitoring for IoCs:
 Ongoing monitoring of CI/CD pipelines, focusing on automated anomaly detection and finding IoCs, makes your security stronger and 
 more proactive. By using monitoring tools to continuously check pipeline activity for these indicators before serious damage 
 occurs, you can:

 ->Respond to Incidents Quickly: Finding IoCs early helps security teams respond rapidly to potential attacks, stopping problems 
   before attackers reach their goals.

 ->Limit the Damage: Responding quickly based on IoC detection reduces the possible impact of a security issue by limiting how long 
   attackers are in the pipeline.

 ->Improve Threat Knowledge: Checking IoCs gives valuable information about how attackers are targeting your CI/CD, which helps 
   improve security and threat hunting in the future.
