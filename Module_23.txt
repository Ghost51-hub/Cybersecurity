Detection:
Detection refers to the prompt discovery of security events.

 Methods of detection:
 
 Threat Hunter: Threat hunting is the proactive search for threats on a network. Security professionals use threat hunting to 
 uncover malicious activity that was not identified by detection tools and as a way to do further analysis on detections. Threat 
 hunting is also used to detect threats before they cause damage. For example, fileless malware is difficult for detection tools to 
 identify. It’s a form of malware that uses sophisticated evasion techniques such as hiding in memory instead of using files or 
 applications, allowing it to bypass traditional methods of detection like signature analysis. With threat hunting, the combination 
 of active human analysis and technology is used to identify threats like fileless malware. 

 Threat intelligence:
 Organizations can improve their detection capabilities by staying updated on the evolving threat landscape and understanding the 
 relationship between their environment and malicious actors. One way to understand threats is by using threat intelligence, which 
 is evidence-based threat information that provides context about existing or emerging threats. 

 Threat intelligence can come from private or public sources like:

 ->Industry reports: These often include details about attacker's tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP).

 ->Government advisories: Similar to industry reports, government advisories include details about attackers' TTP. 

 ->Threat data feeds: Threat data feeds provide a stream of threat-related data that can be used to help protect against 
   sophisticated attackers like advanced persistent threats (APTs). APTs are instances when a threat actor maintains unauthorized 
   access to a system for an extended period of time. The data is usually a list of indicators like IP addresses, domains, and file 
   hashes.

 It can be difficult for organizations to efficiently manage large volumes of threat intelligence. Organizations can leverage a 
 threat intelligence platform (TIP) which is an application that collects, centralizes, and analyzes threat intelligence from 
 different sources. TIPs provide a centralized platform for organizations to identify and prioritize relevant threats and improve 
 their security posture. 

 Note: Threat intelligence data feeds are best used to add context to detections. They should not drive detections completely and 
 should be assessed before applied to an organization.

 Cyber deception:
 Cyber deception involves techniques that deliberately deceive malicious actors with the goal of increasing detection and improving 
 defensive strategies. Honeypots are an example of an active cyber defense mechanism that uses deception technology. Honeypots are 
 systems or resources that are created as decoys vulnerable to attacks with the purpose of attracting potential intruders. For 
 example, having a fake file labeled Client Credit Card Information - 2022 can be used to capture the activity of malicious actors 
 by tricking them into accessing the file because it appears to be legitimate. Once a malicious actor tries to access this file, 
 security teams are alerted.
