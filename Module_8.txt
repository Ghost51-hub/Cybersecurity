Playbook:
A playbook is a manual that provides details about any operational action. Essentially, a playbook provides a predefined and 
up-to-date list of steps to perform when responding to an incident.

Playbooks are accompanied by a strategy. The strategy outlines expectations of team members who are assigned a task, and some 
playbooks also list the individuals responsible. The outlined expectations are accompanied by a plan. The plan dictates how 
the specific task outlined in the playbook must be completed.

Playbooks should be treated as living documents, which means that they are frequently updated by security team members to address 
industry changes and new threats. Playbooks are generally managed as a collaborative effort, since security team members have 
different levels of expertise.

Updates are often made if:

->A failure is identified, such as an oversight in the outlined policies and procedures, or in the playbook itself. 

->There is a change in industry standards, such as changes in laws or regulatory compliance.

->The cybersecurity landscape changes due to evolving threat actor tactics and techniques.
