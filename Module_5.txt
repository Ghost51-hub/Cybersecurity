CISSP's Eight Domains:

Domain one: Security and risk management:
All organizations must develop their security posture. Security posture is an organization’s ability to manage its defense 
of critical assets and data and react to change. Elements of the security and risk management domain that impact an 
organization's security posture include:

->Security goals and objectives

->Risk mitigation processes

->Compliance

->Business continuity plans

->Legal regulations

->Professional and organizational ethics

Information security, or InfoSec, is also related to this domain and refers to a set of processes established to secure 
information. An organization may use playbooks and implement training as a part of their security and risk management program, 
based on their needs and perceived risk. There are many InfoSec design processes, such as:

->Incident response

->Vulnerability management

->Application security

->Cloud security

->Infrastructure security

As an example, a security team may need to alter how personally identifiable information (PII) is treated in order to adhere 
to the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

Domain two: Asset security:
Asset security involves managing the cybersecurity processes of organizational assets, including the storage, maintenance, 
retention, and destruction of physical and virtual data. Because the loss or theft of assets can expose an organization and 
increase the level of risk, keeping track of assets and the data they hold is essential. Conducting a security impact analysis, 
establishing a recovery plan, and managing data exposure will depend on the level of risk associated with each asset. Security 
analysts may need to store, maintain, and retain data by creating backups to ensure they are able to restore the environment 
if a security incident places the organization’s data at risk.
