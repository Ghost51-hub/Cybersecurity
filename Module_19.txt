Zero-Day:
An exploit that was previously unknown.

CI/CD:
CI/CD automates the entire software release process, from code creation to deployment. This automation is what enables modern 
development teams to be agile and respond quickly to user needs. Let's break down the key parts:

 Continuous Integration (CI): Building a Solid Foundation
 Continuous Integration (CI) is all about frequently merging code changes from different developers into a central location. This 
 triggers automated processes like building the software and running tests. CI catches problems through an automated process: 
 every time code is integrated, the system automatically builds and tests it. This immediate feedback loop reveals integration 
 problems as soon as they occur. CI helps catch integration problems early, leading to higher quality code. Think of it as the 
 foundation of the pipeline.

 Continuous Delivery (CD): Ready to Release
 Continuous Delivery means your code is always ready to be released to users. After passing automated tests, code is automatically 
 deployed to a staging environment (a practice environment) or prepared for final release. Typically, a manual approval step is 
 still needed before going live to production, which provides a control point.

 Continuous Deployment (CD): Fully Automated Releases
 Continuous Deployment automates the entire release process. Changes that pass all automated checks are automatically deployed 
 directly to the live production environment, with no manual approval. This is all about speed and efficiency.

 Security Benefits of Continuous Delivery and Deployment:
 The good news is that Continuous Delivery and Deployment can actually enhance security. CD allows you to build security checks 
 right into your deployment pipeline. This ensures that only thoroughly vetted software versions are released.

 These automated security checks can include:

 ->Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST): Automated tests that find vulnerabilities in running applications in realistic staging environments.

 ->Security Compliance Checks: Automated checks that ensure software meets your organization’s security rules and policies.

 ->Infrastructure Security Validations: Checks that make sure the systems hosting your software are secure.

 Why a secure CI/CD Pipelines is Non-Negotiable:
 To grasp the power of CI/CD is vital.  Pipeline protection is not optional; it is essential. Consider these points:

 ->Secure Automation: CI/CD automates repetitive tasks: building, testing, deploying. When automation is implemented securely, this 
   reduces errors from manual work, speeds processes, and importantly, reduces human errors that create vulnerabilities. However, 
   insecure automation automates the introduction of vulnerabilities at scale.

 ->Improved Code Quality Via Security Checks: Automated tests in CI/CD rigorously check code before release. Crucially, this 
   includes automated security tests. This leads to fewer bugs and security weaknesses in final software, but only if security 
   tests integrate effectively within the pipeline.

 ->Faster Time to Market for Security Updates: CI/CD accelerates releases. This enables faster delivery of new features, bug fixes, 
   and security updates, improving response time to both user needs and security threats. This rapid deployment of security updates 
   is a significant security advantage of a well-secured CI/CD pipeline.

 ->Enhanced Collaboration and Feedback with Safety Focus: CI/CD encourages collaboration between development, security, testing, 
   and operations teams. Quick feedback loops aid identification and resolution of vulnerabilities early in development. This 
   collaborative environment is essential to build security into the pipeline and address vulnerabilities proactively.

 ->Reduced Risk: Frequent, smaller releases, a result of CI/CD, are less risky than large, infrequent releases. If issues arise 
   (including security issues), pinpointing and fixing the problem becomes easier. This also applies to security vulnerabilities; 
   smaller, frequent releases limit the potential impact of a security flaw introduced in any single release, provided security 
   monitoring and testing remain continuous.

 In essence, CI/CD is the engine of modern agile software development. It allows for reliable, efficient, and responsive software 
 delivery. However, an unsecured CI/CD pipeline can become a major entry point for vulnerabilities.

 Common CI/CD Pipeline Vulnerabilities: What to Watch Out For
 Here are some common vulnerabilities to be aware of:

 ->Insecure Dependencies: Risks from Third-Party Code
   CI/CD pipelines often use many third-party libraries and components. If these components have known vulnerabilities (Common 
   Vulnerabilities and Exposures, or CVEs), those vulnerabilities can be unknowingly added to your application during the automated 
   build process.

   Action Step: Regularly scan and update your dependencies. Make sure you’re using secure versions of all external components.

 ->Misconfigured Permissions: Controlling Access
   Weak access controls in CI/CD tools, code repositories, and related systems are a significant vulnerability. Unauthorized access 
   can allow attackers to modify code, pipeline configurations, or inject malicious content.

   Action Step: Implement strong access management using Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). Ensure only authorized individuals can 
   access and change critical pipeline elements.

 ->Lack of Automated Security Testing: Missing Critical Checks
   Failing to include automated security testing in your CI/CD pipeline is a serious error. Without tools like SAST and DAST, you 
   are almost guaranteed to release software full of vulnerabilities that will go undetected until after it's live, leading to 
   significantly higher costs and effort to fix..

   Action Step: Integrate automated security testing (SAST and DAST) into your CI/CD pipeline. This should be a core part of your 
   secure CI/CD strategy.

 ->Exposed Secrets: Protecting Sensitive Information
   Hardcoding sensitive data like API keys, passwords, and tokens directly into code or pipeline settings is a serious security 
   mistake. If exposed, these secrets can lead to major security breaches.

   Action Step: Never hardcode secrets. Use secure vaults or dedicated secrets management tools to store and manage sensitive 
   information. Enforce this practice across your team.

 ->Unsecured Build Environments: Protecting the Pipeline Infrastructure
   The CI/CD environment itself (the servers and systems that run your pipeline) needs to be secure. If this environment is 
   vulnerable, attackers can compromise it to alter builds, inject malicious code, or steal sensitive data.

   Action Step: Harden your build environments. Use secure containers or virtual machines to minimize the risk of a compromised 
   pipeline.

 Building a Secure CI/CD Pipeline: Defense in Depth
 To proactively address these vulnerabilities, a layered security approach is key. Here are essential best practices for your CI/CD 
 security strategy:

 ->Integrate Security from the Start: Embrace DevSecOps: Adopt a DevSecOps mindset. This means building security into every stage 
   of development, from planning to deployment and beyond. This naturally includes embedding security checks into your CI/CD 
   pipeline.

 ->Implement Strong Access Controls: Use strict permission policies based on the principle of least privilege. Only grant necessary 
   access to code, pipeline settings, and deployment configurations. Use tools like Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and 
   Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to secure your CI/CD environment.

 ->Automate Security Testing Everywhere: Make automated security scans and tests a fundamental part of your build and deployment 
   process. Tools like SAST, Software Composition Analysis (SCA), and DAST are not optional extras – they are essential for a 
   secure CI/CD pipeline so you can catch vulnerabilities early.

 ->Keep Dependencies Updated: Maintain a current inventory of all third-party dependencies, libraries, and CI/CD plugins. Regularly 
   update these components to patch security vulnerabilities (CVEs). Tools like Dependabot and Snyk can automate dependency 
   management.

 ->Secure Secrets Management: Never hardcode sensitive information in your code or pipeline configurations. Require the use of 
   dedicated secrets management tools like HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager. Securely store, access, and rotate secrets 
   throughout the CI/CD process.

 Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS):
 A measurement system that scores the severity of a vulnerability.

OWASP:
OWASP is a nonprofit foundation that works to improve the security of software. OWASP is an open platform that security professionals 
from around the world use to share information, tools, and events that are focused on securing the web.

 OWASP Top 10:
 One of OWASP’s most valuable resources is the OWASP Top 10. The organization has published this list since 2003 as a way to spread 
 awareness of the web’s most targeted vulnerabilities. The Top 10 mainly applies to new or custom made software. Many of the world's 
 largest organizations reference the OWASP Top 10 during application development to help ensure their programs address common 
 security mistakes.

 Pro tip: OWASP’s Top 10 is updated every few years as technologies evolve. Rankings are based on how often the vulnerabilities are 
 discovered and the level of risk they present.

 Note: Auditors also use the OWASP Top 10 as one point of reference when checking for regulatory compliance.

 Common vulnerabilities:
 Businesses often make critical security decisions based on the vulnerabilities listed in the OWASP Top 10. This resource influences 
 how businesses design new software that will be on their network, unlike the CVE® list, which helps them identify improvements to 
 existing programs. These are the most regularly listed vulnerabilities that appear in their rankings to know about:

  Broken access control:
  Access controls limit what users can do in a web application. For example, a blog might allow visitors to post comments on a 
  recent article but restricts them from deleting the article entirely. Failures in these mechanisms can lead to unauthorized 
  information disclosure, modification, or destruction. They can also give someone unauthorized access to other business 
  applications.

  Cryptographic failures:
  Information is one of the most important assets businesses need to protect. Privacy laws such as General Data Protection 
  Regulation (GDPR) require sensitive data to be protected by effective encryption methods. Vulnerabilities can occur when 
  businesses fail to encrypt things like personally identifiable information (PII). For example, if a web application uses a weak 
  hashing algorithm, like MD5, it’s more at risk of suffering a data breach.

  Injection:
  Injection occurs when malicious code is inserted into a vulnerable application. Although the app appears to work normally, it 
  does things that it wasn’t intended to do. Injection attacks can give threat actors a backdoor into an organization’s information 
  system. A common target is a website’s login form. When these forms are vulnerable to injection, attackers can insert malicious 
  code that gives them access to modify or steal user credentials. 

  Insecure design:
  Applications should be designed in such a way that makes them resilient to attack. When they aren’t, they’re much more vulnerable 
  to threats like injection attacks or malware infections. Insecure design refers to a wide range of missing or poorly implemented 
  security controls that should have been programmed into an application when it was being developed.

  Security misconfiguration:
  Misconfigurations occur when security settings aren’t properly set or maintained. Companies use a variety of different 
  interconnected systems. Mistakes often happen when those systems aren’t properly set up or audited. A common example is when 
  businesses deploy equipment, like a network server, using default settings. This can lead businesses to use settings that fail to 
  address the organization's security objectives.

  Vulnerable and outdated components:
  Vulnerable and outdated components is a category that mainly relates to application development. Instead of coding everything 
  from scratch, most developers use open-source libraries to complete their projects faster and easier. This publicly available 
  software is maintained by communities of programmers on a volunteer basis. Applications that use vulnerable components that have 
  not been maintained are at greater risk of being exploited by threat actors.

  Identification and authentication failures:
  Identification is the keyword in this vulnerability category. When applications fail to recognize who should have access and what 
  they’re authorized to do, it can lead to serious problems. For example, a home Wi-Fi router normally uses a simple login form to 
  keep unwanted guests off the network. If this defense fails, an attacker can invade the homeowner’s privacy.

  Software and data integrity failures:
  Software and data integrity failures are instances when updates or patches are inadequately reviewed before implementation. 
  Attackers might exploit these weaknesses to deliver malicious software. When that occurs, there can be serious downstream effects. 
  Third parties are likely to become infected if a single system is compromised, an event known as a supply chain attack.

  A famous example of a supply chain attack is the SolarWinds cyber attack (2020) where hackers injected malicious code into 
  software updates that the company unknowingly released to their customers.

  Security logging and monitoring failures:
  In security, it’s important to be able to log and trace back events. Having a record of events like user login attempts is 
  critical to finding and fixing problems. Sufficient monitoring and incident response is equally important.

  Server-side request forgery:
  Companies have public and private information stored on web servers. When you use a hyperlink or click a button on a website, a 
  request is sent to a server that should validate who you are, fetch the appropriate data, and then return it to you. Server-side 
  request forgeries (SSRFs) are when attackers manipulate the normal operations of a server to read or update other resources on 
  that server. These are possible when an application on the server is vulnerable. Malicious code can be carried by the vulnerable 
  app to the host server that will fetch unauthorized data.

OSINT:
Businesses often use information to gain insights into the behavior of their customers. Insights, or intelligence, can then be used 
to improve their decision making. In security, open-source information is used in a similar way to gain insights into threats and 
vulnerabilities that can pose risks to an organization.

OSINT plays a significant role in information security (InfoSec), which is the practice of keeping data in all states away from 
unauthorized users.

For example, a company's InfoSec team is responsible for protecting their network from potential threats. They might utilize OSINT 
to monitor online forums and hacker communities for discussions about emerging vulnerabilities. If they come across a forum post 
discussing a newly discovered weakness in a popular software that the company uses, the team can quickly assess the risk, prioritize 
patching efforts, and implement necessary safeguards to prevent an attack.

Here are some of the ways OSINT can be used to generate intelligence:

->To provide insights into cyber attacks

->To detect potential data exposures

->To evaluate existing defenses

->To identify unknown vulnerabilities

Collecting intelligence is sometimes part of the vulnerability management process. Security teams might use OSINT to develop profiles 
of potential targets and make data driven decisions on improving their defenses.

 OSINT tools:
 There's an enormous amount of open-source information online. Finding relevant information that can be used to gather intelligence 
 is a challenge. Information can be gathered from a variety of sources, such as search engines, social media, discussion boards, 
 blogs, and more. Several tools also exist that can be used in your intelligence gathering process. Here are just a few examples of 
 tools that you can explore:

 ->VirusTotal is a service that allows anyone to analyze suspicious files, domains, URLs, and IP addresses for malicious content.

 ->MITRE ATT&CK® is a knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations.

 ->OSINT Framework is a web-based interface where you can find OSINT tools for almost any kind of source or platform.

 ->Have I been Pwned is a tool that can be used to search for breached email accounts.

Vulnerability Assessment:
The internal review process of an oragnization's security systems.

 Vulenerability assessment Process:
 1.Identification

 2.Vulenerability Analysis

 3.Risk Assessment

 4.Remediation

Vulnerability Scanners:
 A vulnerability scanner is software that automatically compares known vulnerabilities and exposures against the technologies on 
 the network. In general, these tools scan systems to find misconfigurations or programming flaws.

 Scanning tools are used to analyze each of the five attack surfaces of defense in depth strategy:
 ->Perimeter layer, like authentication systems that validate user access

 ->Network layer, which is made up of technologies like network firewalls and others

 ->Endpoint layer, which describes devices on a network, like laptops, desktops, or servers

 ->Application layer, which involves the software that users interact with

 ->Data layer, which includes any information that’s stored, in transit, or in use

 When a scan of any layer begins, the scanning tool compares the findings against databases of security threats. At the end of the 
 scan, the tool flags any vulnerabilities that it finds and adds them to its reference database. Each scan adds more information to 
 the database, helping the tool be more accurate in its analysis.

 Note: Vulnerability databases are also routinely updated by the company that designed the scanning software.

  Performing scans:
  Vulnerability scanners are meant to be non-intrusive. Meaning, they don’t break or take advantage of a system like an attacker 
  would. Instead, they simply scan a surface and alert you to any potentially unlocked doors in your systems.

  Note: While vulnerability scanners are non-intrusive, there are instances when a scan can inadvertently cause issues, like crash 
  a system.

  There are a few different ways that these tools are used to scan a surface. Each approach corresponds to the pathway a threat 
  actor might take.

   External vs. internal:
   External and internal scans simulate an attacker's approach. External scans test the perimeter layer outside of the internal 
   network. They analyze outward facing systems, like websites and firewalls. These kinds of scans can uncover vulnerable things 
   like vulnerable network ports or servers. Internal scans start from the opposite end by examining an organization's internal 
   systems. For example, this type of scan might analyze application software for weaknesses in how it handles user input.

   Authenticated vs. unauthenticated:
   Authenticated and unauthenticated scans simulate whether or not a user has access to a system. Authenticated scans might test a 
   system by logging in with a real user account or even with an admin account. These service accounts are used to check for 
   vulnerabilities, like broken access controls. Unauthenticated scans simulate external threat actors that do not have access to 
   your business resources. For example, a scan might analyze file shares within the organization that are used to house 
   internal-only documents. Unauthenticated users should receive "access denied" results if they tried opening these files. 
   However, a vulnerability would be identified if you were able to access a file.

   Limited vs. comprehensive:
   Limited and comprehensive scans focus on particular devices that are accessed by internal and external users. Limited scans 
   analyze particular devices on a network, like searching for misconfigurations on a firewall. Comprehensive scans analyze all 
   devices connected to a network. This includes operating systems, user databases, and more.

   Pro tip: Discovery scanning should be done prior to limited or comprehensive scans. Discovery scanning is used to get an idea of 
   the computers, devices, and open ports that are on a network.

Patch update:
An outdated computer is a lot like a house with unlocked doors. Malicious actors use these gaps in security the same way, to gain 
unauthorized access. Software updates are similar to locking the doors to keep them out. A patch update is a software and operating 
system update that addresses security vulnerabilities within a program or product. Patches usually contain bug fixes that address 
common security vulnerabilities and exposures.

Note: Ideally, patches address common vulnerabilities and exposures before malicious hackers find them. However, patches are 
sometimes developed as a result of a zero-day, which is an exploit that was previously unknown.

 Common update strategies:
 When software updates become available, clients and users have two installation options:

 ->Manual updates:
   A manual deployment strategy relies on IT departments or users obtaining updates from the developers. Home office or small 
   business environments might require you to find, download, and install updates yourself. In enterprise settings, the process is 
   usually handled with a configuration management tool. These tools offer a range of options to deploy updates, like to all 
   clients on your network or a select group of users.  

   Advantage: An advantage of manual update deployment strategies is control. That can be useful if software updates are not 
   thoroughly tested by developers, leading to instability issues.

   Disadvantage: A drawback to manual update deployments is that critical updates can be forgotten or disregarded entirely.

 ->Automatic updates:
   An automatic deployment strategy takes the opposite approach. With this option, finding, downloading, and installing updates can 
   be done by the system or application.

   Pro tip: The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) recommends using automatic options whenever they’re available.

   Certain permissions need to be enabled by users or IT groups before updates can be installed, or pushed, when they're available. 
   It is up to the developers to adequately test their patches before release.

   Advantage: An advantage to automatic updates is that the deployment process is simplified. It also keeps systems and software 
   current with the latest, critical patches.

   Disadvantage: A drawback to automatic updates is that instability issues can occur if the patches were not thoroughly tested by 
 the vendor. This can result in performance problems and a poor user experience.
