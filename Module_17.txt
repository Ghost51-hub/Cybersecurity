Asset Management:
Asset management is the process of tracking assets and the risks that affect them. The idea behind this process is simple: you can 
only protect what you know you have. 

Asset Classification:
Regardless of its type, every asset should be classified and accounted for. As you may recall, asset classification is the 
practice of labeling assets based on sensitivity and importance to an organization. Determining each of those two factors varies, 
but the sensitivity and importance of an asset typically requires knowing the following:

->What you have

->Where it is

->Who owns it

->How important it is

An organization that classifies its assets does so based on these characteristics. Doing so helps them determine the sensitivity 
and value of an asset.

 Common asset classifications:
 Asset classification helps organizations implement an effective risk management strategy. It also helps them prioritize security 
 resources, reduce IT costs, and stay in compliance with legal regulations.

 The most common classification scheme is:

 ->Restricted is the highest level. This category is reserved for incredibly sensitive assets,  like need-to-know information.

 ->Confidential refers to assets whose disclosure may lead to a significant negative impact on an organization.

 ->Internal-only describes assets that are available to employees and business partners.

 Public is the lowest level of classification. These assets have no negative consequences to the organization if they’re released.

 Note: Although many organizations adopt this classification scheme, there can be variability at the highest levels. For example, 
 government organizations label their most sensitive assets as confidential instead of restricted.

Data:
Information that is translated, processed, or stored by a computer.

 States of Data:

 ->Data in use: Data being accessed by one or more users.

 ->Data in transit: Data that is moving between two or more systems.

 ->Data at rest: Data not currently being accessed.

Cloud-based services:
The term cloud-based services refers to a variety of on demand or web-based business solutions. Depending on a company’s needs and 
budget, services can range from website hosting, to application development environments, to entire back-end infrastructure.

There are three main categories of cloud-based services:

->Software as a service (SaaS): SaaS refers to front-end applications that users access via a web browser. The service providers 
  host, manage, and maintain all of the back-end systems for those applications. Common examples of SaaS services include 
  applications like Gmail™ email service, Slack, and Zoom software.

->Platform as a service (PaaS): PaaS refers to back-end application development tools that clients can access online. Developers 
  use these resources to write code and build, manage, and deploy their own apps. Meanwhile, the cloud service providers host and 
  maintain the back-end hardware and software that the apps use to operate. Some examples of PaaS services include Google App 
  Engine™ platform, Heroku®, and VMware Cloud Foundry.

->Infrastructure as a service (IaaS): IaaS customers are given remote access to a range of back-end systems that are hosted by the 
  cloud service provider. This includes data processing servers, storage, networking resources, and more. Resources are commonly 
  licensed as needed, making it a cost-effective alternative to buying and maintaining on premises.

  Cloud-based services allow companies to connect with their customers, employees, and business partners over the internet. Some of 
  the largest organizations in the world offer cloud-based services:

   ->Google Cloud Platform

   ->Microsoft Azure 

Types of risk categories:

->Damage

->Disclosure

->Loss of information

Elements of Security plan:

->Policy: A set of rules that reduces risk and protects information.

->Standards: References that inform how to set the policy.

->Procedures: Step-by-step instructions to perform a specific security task.

Compliance: The process of adhering to internal Standards and external regulations.

NIST Cybersecurity Framework(CSF):
A voluntary framework that consists of standards, guidelines, and best practices to manage cybersecurity risk.

 NIST CSF Components:

 ->Core:The CSF core is a set of desired cybersecurity outcomes that help organizations customize their security plan. It consists 
   of six functions, or parts: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover, and Govern. These functions are commonly used as an 
   informative reference to help organizations identify their most important assets and protect those assets with appropriate 
   safeguards. The CSF core is also used to understand ways to detect attacks and develop response and recovery plans should an 
   attack happen.

 ->Tiers:The CSF tiers are a way of measuring the sophistication of an organization's cybersecurity program. CSF tiers are 
   measured on a scale of 1 to 4. Tier 1 is the lowest score, indicating that a limited set of security controls have been 
   implemented. Overall, CSF tiers are used to assess an organization's security posture and identify areas for improvement.

 ->Profiles:The CSF profiles are pre-made templates of the NIST CSF that are developed by a team of industry experts. CSF profiles
   are tailored to address the specific risks of an organization or industry. They are used to help organizations develop a baseline 
   for their cybersecurity plans, or as a way of comparing their current cybersecurity posture to a specific industry standard.

 Note: The core, tiers, and profiles were each designed to help any business improve their security operations. Although there are 
 only three components, the entire framework consists of a complex system of subcategories and processes.

Implementing the CSF:

->Create a current profile of the security operations and outline the specific needs of your business.

->Perform a risk assessment to identify which of your current operations are meeting business and regulatory standards.

->Analyze and prioritize existing gaps in security operations that place the businesses assets at risk.

->Implement a plan of action to achieve your organization’s goals and objectives.
