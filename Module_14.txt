Linux:
An open-source operating system.

Linux architecture:
A request to complete a task starts with the user and then flows through applications, the shell, the Filesystem Hierarchy 
Standard, the kernel, and the hardware.

 User:
 The user is the person interacting with a computer. They initiate and manage computer tasks. Linux is a multi-user system, which 
 means that multiple users can use the same resources at the same time.

 Applications:
 An application is a program that performs a specific task. There are many different applications on your computer. Some 
 applications typically come pre-installed on your computer, such as calculators or calendars. Other applications might have to 
 be installed, such as some web browsers or email clients. In Linux, you'll often use a package manager to install applications. 
 A package manager is a tool that helps users install, manage, and remove packages or applications. A package is a piece of 
 software that can be combined with other packages to form an application.

 Shell
 The shell is the command-line interpreter. Everything entered into the shell is text based. The shell allows users to give 
 commands to the kernel and receive responses from it. You can think of the shell as a translator between you and your computer. 
 The shell translates the commands you enter so that the computer can perform the tasks you want
