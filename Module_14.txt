Linux:
An open-source operating system.

Linux architecture:
A request to complete a task starts with the user and then flows through applications, the shell, the Filesystem Hierarchy 
Standard, the kernel, and the hardware.

 User:
 The user is the person interacting with a computer. They initiate and manage computer tasks. Linux is a multi-user system, which 
 means that multiple users can use the same resources at the same time.

 Applications:
 An application is a program that performs a specific task. There are many different applications on your computer. Some 
 applications typically come pre-installed on your computer, such as calculators or calendars. Other applications might have to 
 be installed, such as some web browsers or email clients. In Linux, you'll often use a package manager to install applications. 
 A package manager is a tool that helps users install, manage, and remove packages or applications. A package is a piece of 
 software that can be combined with other packages to form an application.
