Encryption:
The eprocess of converting data from a readable format to an encoded format.

Authentication:
The process of verifying who someone or something is.

Biometrics:
Unique physical characteristics that can be used to verify a person's identity.

Authorization:
The concept of granting access to specific resources within a system.

Frameworks and controls:-
Security frameworks: are guidelines used for building plans to help mitigate risk and threats to data and privacy. 
Frameworks support organizations’ ability to adhere to compliance laws and regulations. For example, the healthcare industry 
uses frameworks to comply with the United States’ Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), which requires 
that medical professionals keep patient information safe. 

Security controls: are safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks. Security controls are the measures organizations 
use to lower risk and threats to data and privacy. For example, a control that can be used alongside frameworks to ensure a 
hospital remains compliant with HIPAA is requiring that patients use multi-factor authentication (MFA) to access their medical 
records. Using a measure like MFA to validate someone’s identity is one way to help mitigate potential risks and threats to 
private data.

Specific frameworks and controls:-

Cyber Threat Framework (CTF):
According to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the CTF was developed by the U.S. government to provide “a 
common language for describing and communicating information about cyber threat activity.” By providing a common language to 
communicate information about threat activity, the CTF helps cybersecurity professionals analyze and share information more 
efficiently. This allows organizations to improve their response to the constantly evolving cybersecurity landscape and threat 
actors' many tactics and techniques.
