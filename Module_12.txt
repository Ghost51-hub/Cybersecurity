Security Hardening:
The process of strengthening a system to reduce its vulnerability and attack surface.

 Attack Surface:
 All the potential vulnerabilities that a threat actor could exploit.

 Security Hardening is conducted on:
 ->Hardware

 ->Operating System 

 ->Applications

 ->Computer networks

Penetration Test:
A simulated attack that helps identify vulnerabilities in system, networks, websites, applications, and processes.

Operating System (OS):
The interface between computer hardware and the user.

 Patch Update:
 A software and operating system update that addresses security vulnerabilities within a program or product.

 Baseline Configuration (baseline image):
 A documented set of specifiations within a system that is used as a basis for future builds, releases, and updates.

Multi-factor authentication (MFA):
A security measure which requires a user to verify their identity in two or more ways to access a system or network.

 Categories fo multi-factor identification:
 ->Something you know

 ->Something you have

 ->Something unique about you

Brute Force AttacksL
A brute force attack is a trial-and-error process of discovering private information. There are different types of brute force 
attacks that malicious actors use to guess passwords, including: 

 ->Simple brute force attacks. When attackers try to guess a user's login credentials, it’s considered a simple brute force attack. 
   They might do this by entering any combination of usernames and passwords that they can think of until they find the one that 
   works.

 ->Dictionary attacks use a similar technique. In dictionary attacks, attackers use a list of commonly used passwords and stolen 
   credentials from previous breaches to access a system. These are called “dictionary” attacks because attackers originally used 
   a list of words from the dictionary to guess the passwords, before complex password rules became a common security practice. 

Using brute force to access a system can be a tedious and time consuming process, especially when it’s done manually. There are a 
range of tools attackers use to conduct their attacks.
