Security Hardening:
The process of strengthening a system to reduce its vulnerability and attack surface.

 Attack Surface:
 All the potential vulnerabilities that a threat actor could exploit.

 Security Hardening is conducted on:
 ->Hardware

 ->Operating System 

 ->Applications

 ->Computer networks

Penetration Test:
A simulated attack that helps identify vulnerabilities in system, networks, websites, applications, and processes.

Operating System (OS):
The interface between computer hardware and the user.

 Patch Update:
 A software and operating system update that addresses security vulnerabilities within a program or product.

 Baseline Configuration (baseline image):
 A documented set of specifiations within a system that is used as a basis for future builds, releases, and updates.

Multi-factor authentication (MFA):
A security measure which requires a user to verify their identity in two or more ways to access a system or network.

 Categories fo multi-factor identification:
 ->Something you know

 ->Something you have

 ->Something unique about you

Brute Force AttacksL
A brute force attack is a trial-and-error process of discovering private information. There are different types of brute force 
attacks that malicious actors use to guess passwords, including: 

 ->Simple brute force attacks. When attackers try to guess a user's login credentials, it’s considered a simple brute force attack. 
   They might do this by entering any combination of usernames and passwords that they can think of until they find the one that 
   works.

 ->Dictionary attacks use a similar technique. In dictionary attacks, attackers use a list of commonly used passwords and stolen 
   credentials from previous breaches to access a system. These are called “dictionary” attacks because attackers originally used 
   a list of words from the dictionary to guess the passwords, before complex password rules became a common security practice. 

Using brute force to access a system can be a tedious and time consuming process, especially when it’s done manually. There are a 
range of tools attackers use to conduct their attacks. 

Assessing Vulnerabilities:
Before a brute force attack or other cybersecurity incident occurs, companies can run a series of tests on their network or web 
applications to assess vulnerabilities. Analysts can use virtual machines and sandboxes to test suspicious files, check for 
vulnerabilities before an event occurs, or to simulate a cybersecurity incident.

 Virtual machines (VMs):
 Virtual machines (VMs) are software versions of physical computers. VMs provide an additional layer of security for an 
 organization because they can be used to run code in an isolated environment, preventing malicious code from affecting the rest 
 of the computer or system. VMs can also be deleted and replaced by a pristine image after testing malware. 

 VMs are useful when investigating potentially infected machines or running malware in a constrained environment. Using a VM may 
 prevent damage to your system in the event its tools are used improperly. VMs also give you the ability to revert to a previous 
 state. However, there are still some risks involved with VMs. There’s still a small risk that a malicious program can escape 
 virtualization and access the host machine. 

 You can test and explore applications easily with VMs, and it’s easy to switch between different VMs from your computer. This 
 can also help in streamlining many security tasks.

 Sandbox environments
 A sandbox is a type of testing environment that allows you to execute software or programs separate from your network. They are 
 commonly used for testing patches, identifying and addressing bugs, or detecting cybersecurity vulnerabilities. Sandboxes can 
 also be used to evaluate suspicious software, evaluate files containing malicious code, and simulate attack scenarios. 

 Sandboxes can be stand-alone physical computers that are not connected to a network; however, it is often more time- and 
 cost-effective to use software or cloud-based virtual machines as sandbox environments. Note that some malware authors know how 
 to write code to detect if the malware is executed in a VM or sandbox environment. Attackers can program their malware to behave 
 as harmless software when run inside these types of  testing environments.
