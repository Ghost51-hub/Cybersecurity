Security Hardening:
The process of strengthening a system to reduce its vulnerability and attack surface.

 Attack Surface:
 All the potential vulnerabilities that a threat actor could exploit.

 Security Hardening is conducted on:
 ->Hardware

 ->Operating System 

 ->Applications

 ->Computer networks

Penetration Test:
A simulated attack that helps identify vulnerabilities in system, networks, websites, applications, and processes.

Operating System (OS):
The interface between computer hardware and the user.

 Patch Update:
 A software and operating system update that addresses security vulnerabilities within a program or product.

 Baseline Configuration (baseline image):
 A documented set of specifiations within a system that is used as a basis for future builds, releases, and updates.

Multi-factor authentication (MFA):
A security measure which requires a user to verify their identity in two or more ways to access a system or network.
