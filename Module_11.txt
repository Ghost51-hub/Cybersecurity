Network interception attacks:
Network interception attacks work by intercepting network traffic and stealing valuable information or interfering with the 
transmission in some way.

Malicious actors can use hardware or software tools to capture and inspect data in transit. This is referred to as packet 
sniffing. In addition to seeing information that they are not entitled to, malicious actors can also intercept network traffic 
and alter it. These attacks can cause damage to an organization’s network by inserting malicious code modifications or altering 
the message and interrupting network operations. For example, an attacker can intercept a bank transfer and change the account 
receiving the funds to one that the attacker controls.
