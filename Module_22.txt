Network Traffic:
The amount of data that moves across a network.

Network Data:
The data that's transmitted between devices on a network.

Indicators of Compromise (IOCs):
Observable evidence that suggests signs of a potential security incident.

Data Exfiltration:
Unauthorized transmission of data from a system.

Monitor Your Network:
networks connect devices, and devices then communicate and exchange data using network protocols. Network communications provide 
information about connections such as source and destination IP addresses, amount of data transferred, date and time, and more. 
This information can be valuable for security professionals when developing a baseline of normal or expected behavior. 

 Flow analysis:
 Flow refers to the movement of network communications and includes information related to packets, protocols, and ports. Packets 
 can travel to ports, which receive and transmit communications. Ports are often, but not always, associated with network protocols. 
 For example, port 443 is commonly used by HTTPS which is a protocol that provides website traffic encryption. However, malicious 
 actors can use protocols and ports that are not commonly associated to maintain communications between the compromised system and 
 their own machine. These communications are what’s known as command and control (C2), which are the techniques used by malicious 
 actors to maintain communications with compromised systems. For example, malicious actors can use HTTPS protocol over port 8088 as 
 opposed to its commonly associated port 443 to communicate with compromised systems. Organizations must know which ports should be 
 open and approved for connections, and watch out for any mismatches between ports and their associated protocols.

 Packet payload information:
 Network packets contain components related to the transmission of the packet. This includes details like source and destination IP 
 address, and the packet payload information, which is the actual data that’s transmitted. Often, this data is encrypted and requires 
 decryption for it to be readable. Organizations can monitor the payload information of packets to uncover unusual activity, such 
 as sensitive data transmitting outside of the network, which could indicate a possible data exfiltration attack.

 Temporal patterns:
 Network packets contain information relating to time. This information is useful in understanding time patterns. For example, a 
 company operating in North America experiences bulk traffic flows between 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., which is the baseline of normal network 
 activity. If large volumes of traffic are suddenly outside of the normal hours of network activity, then this is considered off 
 baseline and should be investigated. Through network monitoring, organizations can promptly detect network intrusions and work to 
 prevent them from happening by securing network components.
