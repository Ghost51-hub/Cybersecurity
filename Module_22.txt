Network Traffic:
The amount of data that moves across a network.

Network Data:
The data that's transmitted between devices on a network.

Indicators of Compromise (IOCs):
Observable evidence that suggests signs of a potential security incident.

Data Exfiltration:
Unauthorized transmission of data from a system.

Monitor Your Network:
networks connect devices, and devices then communicate and exchange data using network protocols. Network communications provide 
information about connections such as source and destination IP addresses, amount of data transferred, date and time, and more. 
This information can be valuable for security professionals when developing a baseline of normal or expected behavior. 

 Flow analysis:
 Flow refers to the movement of network communications and includes information related to packets, protocols, and ports. Packets 
 can travel to ports, which receive and transmit communications. Ports are often, but not always, associated with network protocols. 
 For example, port 443 is commonly used by HTTPS which is a protocol that provides website traffic encryption. However, malicious 
 actors can use protocols and ports that are not commonly associated to maintain communications between the compromised system and 
 their own machine. These communications are what’s known as command and control (C2), which are the techniques used by malicious 
 actors to maintain communications with compromised systems. For example, malicious actors can use HTTPS protocol over port 8088 as 
 opposed to its commonly associated port 443 to communicate with compromised systems. Organizations must know which ports should be 
 open and approved for connections, and watch out for any mismatches between ports and their associated protocols.

 Packet payload information:
 Network packets contain components related to the transmission of the packet. This includes details like source and destination IP 
 address, and the packet payload information, which is the actual data that’s transmitted. Often, this data is encrypted and requires 
 decryption for it to be readable. Organizations can monitor the payload information of packets to uncover unusual activity, such 
 as sensitive data transmitting outside of the network, which could indicate a possible data exfiltration attack.

 Temporal patterns:
 Network packets contain information relating to time. This information is useful in understanding time patterns. For example, a 
 company operating in North America experiences bulk traffic flows between 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., which is the baseline of normal network 
 activity. If large volumes of traffic are suddenly outside of the normal hours of network activity, then this is considered off 
 baseline and should be investigated. Through network monitoring, organizations can promptly detect network intrusions and work to 
 prevent them from happening by securing network components.

 Protect your network:
 Organizations may deploy a network operations center (NOC), which is an organizational unit that monitors the performance of a 
 network and responds to any network disruption, such as a network outage. While a SOC is focused on maintaining the security of an 
 organization through detection and response, a NOC is responsible for maintaining network performance, availability, and uptime. 
 Security analysts monitor networks to identify any signs of potential security incidents known as indicators of compromise (IoC) 
 and  protect networks from threats or attacks. To do this, they must understand the environment that network communications travel 
 through so that they can identify deviations in network traffic. 

 Network monitoring tools:
 Network monitoring can be automated or performed manually. Some common network monitoring tools can include: 

 ->Intrusion detection systems (IDS) monitor system activity and alert on possible intrusions. An IDS will detect and alert on the 
   deviations you’ve configured it to detect. Most commonly, IDS tools will monitor the content of packet payload to detect patterns
   associated with threats such as malware or phishing attempts.

 ->Network protocol analyzers, also known as packet sniffers, are tools designed to capture and analyze data traffic within a network. 
   They can be used to analyze network communications manually in detail. Examples include tools such as tcpdump and Wireshark, which 
   can be used by security professionals to record network communications through packet captures. Packet captures can then be 
   investigated to identify potentially malicious activity.

Packets:
A data packet is a basic unit of information that travels from one device to another within a network. Detecting network intrusions 
begins at the packet level. That's because packets form the basis of information exchange over a network. Each time you perform an 
activity on the internet—like visiting a website—packets are sent and received between your computer and the website’s server. 
These packets are what help transmit information through a network. For example, when uploading an image to a website, the data gets 
broken up into multiple packets, which then get routed to the intended destination and reassembled upon delivery. 

 Components of a packet:

 1.Header: Packets begin with the most essential component: the header. Packets can have several headers depending on the protocols 
   used such as an Ethernet header, an IP header, a TCP header, and more. Headers provide information that’s used to route packets 
   to their destination. This includes information about the source and destination IP addresses, packet length, protocol, packet 
   identification numbers, and more. 

 2.Payload: The payload component directly follows the header and contains the actual data being delivered. Think back to the example 
   of uploading an image to a website; the payload of this packet would be the image itself.

 3.Footer: The footer, also known as the trailer, is located at the end of a packet. The Ethernet protocol uses footers to provide 
   error-checking information to determine if data has been corrupted. In addition, Ethernet network packets that are analyzed might 
   not display footer information due to network configurations.

   Note: Most protocols, such as the Internet Protocol (IP), do not use footers. 

Network protocol analyzers:
Network protocol analyzers (packet sniffers) are tools designed to capture and analyze data traffic within a network. Examples of 
network protocol analyzers include tcpdump, Wireshark, and TShark. Beyond their use in security as an investigative tool used to 
monitor networks and identify suspicious activity, network protocol analyzers can be used to collect network statistics, such as 
bandwidth or speed, and troubleshoot network performance issues, like slowdowns. Network protocol analyzers can also be used for 
malicious purposes. For example, malicious actors can use network protocol analyzers to capture packets containing sensitive data, 
such as account login information.

 How network protocol analyzers work:
 Network protocol analyzers use both software and hardware capabilities to capture network traffic and display it for security 
 analysts to examine and analyze. Here’s how:

 1.First, packets must be collected from the network via the Network Interface Card (NIC), which is hardware that connects computers 
 to a network, like a router. NICs receive and transmit network traffic, but by default they only listen to network traffic that’s 
 addressed to them. To capture all network traffic that is sent over the network, a NIC must be switched to a mode that has access 
 to all visible network data packets. In wireless interfaces this is often referred to as monitoring mode, and in other systems it 
 may be called promiscuous mode. This mode enables the NIC to have access to all visible network data packets, but it won’t help 
 analysts access all packets across a network. A network protocol analyzer must be positioned in an appropriate network segment to 
 access all traffic between different hosts. 

 2.The network protocol analyzer collects the network traffic in raw binary format. Binary format consists of 0s and 1s and is not 
 as easy for humans to interpret. The network protocol analyzer takes the binary and converts it so that it’s displayed in a 
 human-readable format, so analysts can easily read and understand the information.  

 Note: Enabling promiscuous can expose your device to potential attacks because it allows sensitive information like passwords and 
 other confidential data to be captured. It's important to use tools that operate in promiscuous mode responsibly and with caution.
