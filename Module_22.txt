Network Traffic:
The amount of data that moves across a network.

Network Data:
The data that's transmitted between devices on a network.

Indicators of Compromise (IOCs):
Observable evidence that suggests signs of a potential security incident.

Data Exfiltration:
Unauthorized transmission of data from a system.

Monitor Your Network:
networks connect devices, and devices then communicate and exchange data using network protocols. Network communications provide 
information about connections such as source and destination IP addresses, amount of data transferred, date and time, and more. 
This information can be valuable for security professionals when developing a baseline of normal or expected behavior. 

 Flow analysis:
 Flow refers to the movement of network communications and includes information related to packets, protocols, and ports. Packets 
 can travel to ports, which receive and transmit communications. Ports are often, but not always, associated with network protocols. 
 For example, port 443 is commonly used by HTTPS which is a protocol that provides website traffic encryption. However, malicious 
 actors can use protocols and ports that are not commonly associated to maintain communications between the compromised system and 
 their own machine. These communications are whatâ€™s known as command and control (C2), which are the techniques used by malicious 
 actors to maintain communications with compromised systems. For example, malicious actors can use HTTPS protocol over port 8088 as 
 opposed to its commonly associated port 443 to communicate with compromised systems. Organizations must know which ports should be 
 open and approved for connections, and watch out for any mismatches between ports and their associated protocols.
