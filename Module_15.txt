Helpful navigation tips and keyboard shortcuts:
The following contains a list of navigation tips and keyboard shortcuts you may find useful when completing your Linux labs. 
Your cursor must be in the terminal window to use these navigation tips and keyboard shortcuts.

->CTRL + C: Terminates a command that is currently running; from the instructions portion of Qwiklabs, you can use CTRL + C to copy,
but within the terminal, it will only terminate a command and if one isn't running, it will display ^C at the prompt

->CTRL + V: Pastes text

->CTRL + A: Sets your cursor at the beginning of a command

->CTRL + E: Sets your cursor at the end of a command

->Left arrow key: Moves left within a command

->Right arrow key: Moves right within a command

->Up arrow key: Provides the last command you entered into the command line; can be entered multiple times to go through multiple 
  commands from the command history

->Down arrow key: Provides the next command in the command history; must be after using the up arrow key

->Tab key: Provides available suggestions for completing your text

Linux Commands:

 ->application_name: To check if the apllication is installed.

 ->application_name --version: To check the version of installed application.

 ->sudo apt install application_name: To install the application.

 ->sudo apt remove application_name: To uninstall the application.

 ->apt list --installed: It gives the list of application installed.

 ->clear: Clears the terminal screen; this can also be done by entering CTRL + L.

 ->echo: This command in the Bash shell outputs a specified string of text.

 ->expr: This command performs basic mathematical calculation. (put space between the operands and operators)

 ->pwd: Prints the working directory onto the screen.

 ->ls: Displays the names of files and directories in the current working directory.
   
   Note: If you want to return the contents of a directory that’s not your current working directory, you can add an argument 
   after ls with the absolute or relative file path to the desired directory. For example, if you’re in the /home/analyst 
   directory but want to list the contents of its projects subdirectory, you can enter ls /home/analyst/projects or just ls 
   projects.

 ->cd: Navigates between directories.

   Pro Tip: You can use the relative file path and enter cd .. to go up one level in the file structure. For example, if the 
   current directory is /home/analyst/projects, entering cd .. would change your working directory to /home/analyst. 

 ->cat file_name: Displays the content of a file. 

 ->head file_name: Displays just the beginning of a file, by default 10 lines.
   
   Pro Tip: If you want to change the number of lines returned by head, you can specify the number of lines by including -n. 
   For example, if you only want to display the first five lines of the updates.txt file, enter head -n 5 updates.txt.

 ->tail file_name: Displays just the end of a file, by default 10 lines.

 ->less file_name: The less command returns the content of a file one page at a time. For example, entering less updates.txt 
   changes the terminal window to display the contents of updates.txt one page at a time. This allows you to easily move forward 
   and backward through the content. 

   Once you’ve accessed your content with the less command, you can use several keyboard controls to move through the file:

    Space bar: Move forward one page

    b: Move back one page

    Down arrow: Move forward one line

    Up arrow: Move back one line

    q: Quit and return to the previous terminal window
