What Security Tasks Can You Automate in CI/CD with Python?
You can use Python to automate many kinds of security tasks in CI/CD pipelines. Here are some main tasks:

 Security Testing:
 ->Static Application Security Testing (SAST): Python scripts can be written to start SAST tools that look at 
   your code for weaknesses before it gets built. Python can also be used to understand the SAST results, create 
   reports, and automatically stop the process if serious security problems are found.

 ->Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST): Python can be used to automatically run DAST tools to test 
   software while it’s running in a test area. Then, Python scripts can look at the DAST results and give 
   feedback in the CI/CD pipeline.

 ->Software Composition Analysis (SCA): Python can work with SCA tools to check your software’s dependencies 
   for weaknesses. Dependencies are things like open source code and components from other companies. Scripts 
   can control the SCA process, report problems, and set rules based on the severity of weaknesses.
