String:
String data is data consisting of an ordered sequence of characters. It's used to store any type of information 
you don't need to manipulate mathematically (such as through division or subtraction). 

 Indices:
 An index is a number assigned to every element in a sequence that indicates its position. With strings, this 
 means each character in the string has its own index.

 Bracket notation
 Bracket notation refers to the indices placed in square brackets. You can use bracket notation to extract a 
 part of a string. For example, the first character of the device ID might represent a certain characteristic 
 of the device. If you want to extract it, you can use bracket notation for this:

 "h32rb17"[0]
 
 This device ID might also be stored within a variable called device_id. You can apply the same bracket notation 
 to the variable:

 device_id = "h32rb17"

 device_id[0]
