Programming:
Used to create a specific a specific set of instructions for a computer to execute tasks.

 Advantages of Python:
 ->Resembles human language

 ->Less code

 ->Easy to read

 ->Standard guidelines

 ->Online support

 ->Built-in code

Automation:
The use of technology to reduce human and manual effort to perform common and repetitive tasks.

Python in cybersecurity
In cybersecurity, Python is used especially for automation. Automation is the use of technology to reduce human and manual effort to 
perform common and repetitive tasks. These are some specific areas of cybersecurity in which Python might be used to automate specific tasks:

->Log analysis

->Malware analysis

->Access control list management

->Intrusion detection

->Compliance checks

->Network scanning

Comments:
A note programmers make about the intention behind their code.

print():
Outputs a specified object to the screen.

Syntax:
The rules that determine what is correctly structured in a computing language.

Data Type:
A data type is a category for a particular type of data item. 

 String:
 In Python, string data is data consisting of an ordered sequence of characters. Characters in a string may include letters, numbers, symbols, and 
 spaces. These characters must be placed within quotation marks. These are all valid strings:

 ->"updates needed"

 ->"20%"

 ->"5.0"

 ->"35"

 ->"**/**/**" 

 ->""

 List:
 In Python, list data is a data structure that consists of a collection of data in sequential form. Lists elements can be of any data type, such as 
 strings, integers, Booleans, or even other lists. The elements of a list are placed within square brackets, and each element is separated by a comma. 
 The following lists contains elements of various data types:

 ->[12, 36, 54, 1, 7]

 ->["eraab", "arusso", "drosas"]

 ->[True, False, True, True]

 ->[15, "approved", True, 45.5, False]

 ->[]

 Integer:
 In Python, integer data is data consisting of a number that does not include a decimal point. These are all examples of integer data:

 ->-100 

 ->-12

 ->-1

 ->0

 ->1

 ->20

 ->500 

 Float:
 Float data is data consisting of a number with a decimal point. All of the following are examples of float data: 

 ->-2.2

 ->-1.34

 ->0.0

 ->0.34 

 Note: Dividing two integer values or two float values results in float output when you use the symbol /. If you want to return a whole 
 number from a calculation, you must use the symbol // instead.

 Boolean :
 Boolean data is data that can only be one of two values: either True or False. You can also return a Boolean value by comparing numbers.

 Tuple:
 Tuple data is a data structure that consists of a collection of data that cannot be changed. Like lists, tuples can contain elements of 
 varying data types. 

 A difference between tuple data and list data is that it is possible to change the elements in a list, but it is not possible to change 
 the elements in a tuple. This could be useful in a cybersecurity context. For example, if software identifiers are stored in a tuple to ensure 
 that they will not be altered, this can provide assurance that an access control list will only block the intended software.

 The syntax of a tuple is also different from the syntax of a list. A tuple is placed in parentheses rather than brackets. These are all 
 examples of the tuple data type:

 ->("wjaffrey", "arutley", "dkot")

 ->(46, 2, 13, 2, 8, 0, 0)

 ->(True, False, True, True)

 ->("wjaffrey", 13, True)

 Pro tip: Tuples are more memory efficient than lists, so they are useful when you are working with a large quantity of data.

 Dictionary:
 Dictionary data is data that consists of one or more key-value pairs. Each key is mapped to a value. A colon (:) is placed 
 between the key and value. Commas separate key-value pairs from other key-value pairs, and the dictionary is placed within curly 
 brackets ({}). 

 Dictionaries are useful when you want to store and retrieve data in a predictable way. For example, the following dictionary maps 
 a building name to a number. The building name is the value, and the number is the key. A colon is placed after the key.

 ->{ 1: "East",

   2: "West",

   3: "North",

   4: "South" }

 Set
 In Python, set data is data that consists of an unordered collection of unique values. This means no two values in a set can be the same. 

 Elements in a set are always placed within curly brackets and are separated by a comma. These elements can be of any data type. 
 This example of a set contains strings of usernames:
 
 ->{"jlanksy", "drosas", "nmason"}

Variables:
A variable is a container that stores data. It's a named storage location in a computer's memory that can hold a value. It stores the data in 
a particular data type, such as integer, string, or Boolean. The value that is stored in a variable can change. 

 Assigning and reassigning variables:
 If you want to create a variable called username and assign it a value of "nzhao", place the variable to the left of the equals sign and its 
 value to the right:

 # Assign 'username' 
 username = "nzhao"

 If you later reset this username to "zhao2", you still refer to that variable container as username. 

 # Reassign 'username' 
 username = "zhao2"

 Although the contents have changed from "nzhao" to "zhao2", the variable username remains the same. 

 Assigning variables to variables:
 Using a similar process, you can also assign variables to other variables. In the following example, the variable username is assigned to a new 
 variable old_username: 

 # Assign a variable to another variable
 username = "nzhao"

 old_username = username

 Because username contains the string value of "nzhao" and old_username contains the value of username, old_username now contains a value of "nzhao".
