Incident:
An occurence that actually or imminently jeopardizes, without lawful authority, the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of 
information or an information system; or constitutes a violation or imminent threat of violation of law, security policies, security 
procedures, or acceptable use policies.

Intrusion detection system (IDS):
An application that monitors system and network activity and produces alerts on possible intrusions.

Intrusion prevention system (IPS):
An application that monitors system activity for intrusions and take action to stop the activity.

SIEM:
SIEM tools collect and manage security-relevant data that can be used during investigations. This is important because SIEM tools 
provide awareness about the activity that occurs between devices on a network. The information SIEM tools provide can help security 
teams quickly investigate and respond to security incidents. SIEM tools have many advantages that can help security teams effectively 
respond to and manage incidents. Some of the advantages are:

->Access to event data: SIEM tools provide access to the event and activity data that happens on a network, including real-time 
  activity. Networks can be connected to hundreds of different systems and devices. SIEM tools have the ability to ingest all of 
  this data so that it can be accessed.

->Monitoring, detecting, and alerting: SIEM tools continuously monitor systems and networks in real-time. They then analyze the 
  collected data using detection rules to detect malicious activity. If an activity matches the rule, an alert is generated and 
  sent out for security teams to assess.

->Log storage: SIEM tools can act as a system for data retention, which can provide access to historical data. Data can be kept or 
  deleted after a period depending on an organization's requirements. 

 SIEM process:

  1.Collect and aggregate data: The SIEM collects event data from various sources like firewalls, servers, routers, and more. This 
    data, also known as logs, contains event details like timestamps, IP addresses, and more. Logs are a record of events that occur 
    within an organization’s systems. After all of this log data is collected, it gets aggregated in one location. Aggregation refers 
    to the process of consolidating log data into a centralized place. Through collection and aggregation, SIEM tools eliminate the 
    need for manually reviewing and analyzing event data by accessing individual data sources. Instead, all event data is accessible 
    in one location—the SIEM. 

  2.Normalize data: SIEM tools collect data from many different sources. This data must be transformed into a single format so that 
    it can be easily processed by the SIEM. However, each data source is different and data can be formatted in many different ways. 
    For example, a firewall log can be formatted differently than a server log. Collected event data should go through the process 
    of normalization. Normalization converts data into a standard, structured format that is easily searchable. 

  3.Analyze data: After log data has been collected, aggregated, and normalized, the SIEM must do something useful with all of the 
    data to enable security teams to investigate threats. During this final step in the process, SIEM tools analyze the data. 
    Analysis can be done with some type of detection logic such as a set of rules and conditions. SIEM tools then apply these 
    rules to the data, and if any of the log activity matches a rule, alerts are sent out to cybersecurity teams.

    Note: A part of the analysis process includes correlation. Correlation involves the comparison of multiple log events to 
    identify common patterns that indicate potential security threats.
