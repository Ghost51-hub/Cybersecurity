Programming languages: By understanding how to use programming languages, cybersecurity analysts can automate tasks that 
would otherwise be very time consuming. Examples of tasks that programming can be used for include searching data to identify 
potential threats or organizing and analyzing information to identify patterns related to security issues.

Security information and event management (SIEM) tools: SIEM tools collect and analyze log data, or records of events such as 
unusual login behavior, and support analysts’ ability to monitor critical activities in an organization. This helps cybersecurity 
professionals identify and analyze potential security threats, risks, and vulnerabilities more efficiently.

Intrusion detection systems (IDSs): Cybersecurity analysts use IDSs to monitor system activity and alerts for possible intrusions. 
It’s important to become familiar with IDSs because they’re a key tool that every organization uses to protect assets and data. 
For example, you might use an IDS to monitor networks for signs of malicious activity, like unauthorized access to a network.

Threat landscape knowledge: Being aware of current trends related to threat actors, malware, or threat methodologies is vital. 
This knowledge allows security teams to build stronger defenses against threat actor tactics and techniques. By staying up to 
date on attack trends and patterns, security professionals are better able to recognize when new types of threats emerge such 
as a new ransomware variant. 

Incident response: Cybersecurity analysts need to be able to follow established policies and procedures to respond to incidents 
appropriately. For example, a security analyst might receive an alert about a possible malware attack, then follow the 
organization’s outlined procedures to start the incident response process. This could involve conducting an investigation to
identify the root issue and establishing ways to remediate it.
