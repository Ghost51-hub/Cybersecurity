Open-source tools:
Open-source tools are often free to use and can be user friendly. The objective of open-source tools is to provide users 
with software that is built by the public in a collaborative way, which can result in the software being more secure. 
Additionally, open-source tools allow for more customization by users, resulting in a variety of new services built from 
the same open-source software package. 

Software engineers create open-source projects to improve software and make it available for anyone to use, as long as 
the specified license is respected. The source code for open-source projects is readily available to users, as well as 
the training material that accompanies them. Having these sources readily available allows users to modify and improve 
project materials.
