Functions:
A function is a section of code that can be reused in a program. Functions are important in Python because they allow you to 
automate repetitive parts of your code. 

In Python, you'll work with built-in functions and user-defined functions. Built-in functions are functions that exist within 
Python and can be called directly. The print() function is an example of a built-in function.

User-defined functions are functions that programmers design for their specific needs. To define a function, you need to include 
a function header and the body of your function.

 Function header:
 The function header is what tells Python that you are starting to define a function. For example, if you want to define a function 
 that displays an "investigate activity" message, you can include this function header:

 def display_investigation_message():

 The def keyword is placed before a function name to define a function. In this case, the name of that function is 
 display_investigation_message. 

 Function body
 The body of the function is an indented block of code after the function header that defines what the function does. The indentation is very important when writing a function because it separates the definition of a function from the rest of the code.

 To add a body to your definition of the display_investigation_message() function, add an indented line with the print() function. Your function definition becomes the following:

 def display_investigation_message():

     print("investigate activity")
