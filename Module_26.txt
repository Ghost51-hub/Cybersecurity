Functions:
A function is a section of code that can be reused in a program. Functions are important in Python because they allow you to 
automate repetitive parts of your code. 

In Python, you'll work with built-in functions and user-defined functions. Built-in functions are functions that exist within 
Python and can be called directly. The print() function is an example of a built-in function.

User-defined functions are functions that programmers design for their specific needs. To define a function, you need to include 
a function header and the body of your function.

 Function header:
 The function header is what tells Python that you are starting to define a function. For example, if you want to define a function 
 that displays an "investigate activity" message, you can include this function header:

 def display_investigation_message():

 The def keyword is placed before a function name to define a function. In this case, the name of that function is 
 display_investigation_message. 

 Function body
 The body of the function is an indented block of code after the function header that defines what the function does. The 
 indentation is very important when writing a function because it separates the definition of a function from the rest of the code.

 To add a body to your definition of the display_investigation_message() function, add an indented line with the print() function. 
 Your function definition becomes the following:

 def display_investigation_message():

     print("investigate activity")

 Calling a function:
 After defining a function, you can use it as many times as needed in your code. Using a function after defining it is referred to as 
 calling a function. To call a function, write its name followed by parentheses. So, for the function you previously defined, you can 
 use the following code to call it:

 display_investigation_message()

 Parameters:
 A parameter is an object that is included in a function definition for use in that function. When you define a function, you create 
 variables in the function header. They can then be used in the body of the function. In this context, these variables are called parameters.  
 For example, consider the following function:

 def remaining_login_attempts(maximum_attempts, total_attempts):

     print(maximum_attempts - total_attempts)

 This function takes in two variables, maximum_attempts and total_attempts and uses them to perform a calculation. In this example, 
 maximum_attempts and total_attempts are parameters.

 Arguments:
 In Python, an argument is the data brought into a function when it is called. When calling remaining_login_attempts in the following example, 
 the integers 3 and 2 are considered arguments:

 remaining_login_attempts(3, 2)

 These integers pass into the function through the parameters that were identified when defining the function. In this case, those parameters 
 would be maximum_attempts and total_attempts. 3 is in the first position, so it passes into maximum_attempts. Similarly, 2 is in the second 
 position and passes into total_attempts.
