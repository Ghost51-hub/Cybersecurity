Network Protocols:
A network protocol is a set of rules used by two or more devices on a network to describe the order of delivery and the structure 
of data. Network protocols serve as instructions that come with the information in the data packet. These instructions tell the 
receiving device what to do with the data. Protocols are like a common language that allows devices all across the world to 
communicate with and understand each other.

Even though network protocols perform an essential function in network communication, security analysts should still understand 
their associated security implications. Some protocols have vulnerabilities that malicious actors exploit. For example, a 
nefarious actor could use the Domain Name System (DNS) protocol, which resolves web addresses to IP addresses, to divert traffic 
from a legitimate website to a malicious website containing malware. 

Three categories of network protocols:
Network protocols can be divided into three main categories: communication protocols, management protocols, and security 
protocols. There are dozens of different network protocols, but you don’t need to memorize all of them for an entry-level 
security analyst role. However, it’s important for you to know the ones listed in this reading. 

 Communication protocols:
 Communication protocols govern the exchange of information in network transmission. They dictate how the data is transmitted 
 between devices and the timing of the communication. They also include methods to recover data lost in transit. Here are a few 
 of them.

  ->Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is an internet communication protocol that allows two devices to form a connection and 
    stream data. TCP uses a three-way handshake process. First, the device sends a synchronize (SYN) request to a server. 
    Then the server responds with a SYN/ACK packet to acknowledge receipt of the device's request. Once the server receives the 
    final ACK packet from the device, a TCP connection is established. In the TCP/IP model, TCP occurs at the transport layer.

  ->User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is a connectionless protocol that does not establish a connection between devices before a 
    transmission. This makes it less reliable than TCP. But it also means that it works well for transmissions that need to get 
    to their destination quickly. For example, one use of UDP is for sending DNS requests to local DNS servers. In the TCP/IP 
    model, UDP occurs at the transport layer.
