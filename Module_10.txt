Overview of network protocols
A network protocol is a set of rules used by two or more devices on a network to describe the order of delivery and the structure of data. Network protocols serve as instructions that come with the information in the data packet. These instructions tell the receiving device what to do with the data. Protocols are like a common language that allows devices all across the world to communicate with and understand each other.

Even though network protocols perform an essential function in network communication, security analysts should still understand their associated security implications. Some protocols have vulnerabilities that malicious actors exploit. For example, a nefarious actor could use the Domain Name System (DNS) protocol, which resolves web addresses to IP addresses, to divert traffic from a legitimate website to a malicious website containing malware.
