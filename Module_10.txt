Network Protocols:
A network protocol is a set of rules used by two or more devices on a network to describe the order of delivery and the structure 
of data. Network protocols serve as instructions that come with the information in the data packet. These instructions tell the 
receiving device what to do with the data. Protocols are like a common language that allows devices all across the world to 
communicate with and understand each other.

Even though network protocols perform an essential function in network communication, security analysts should still understand 
their associated security implications. Some protocols have vulnerabilities that malicious actors exploit. For example, a 
nefarious actor could use the Domain Name System (DNS) protocol, which resolves web addresses to IP addresses, to divert traffic 
from a legitimate website to a malicious website containing malware. 

Three categories of network protocols:
Network protocols can be divided into three main categories: communication protocols, management protocols, and security 
protocols. There are dozens of different network protocols, but you don’t need to memorize all of them for an entry-level 
security analyst role. However, it’s important for you to know the ones listed in this reading.
