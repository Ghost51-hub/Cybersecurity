Network Protocols:
A network protocol is a set of rules used by two or more devices on a network to describe the order of delivery and the structure 
of data. Network protocols serve as instructions that come with the information in the data packet. These instructions tell the 
receiving device what to do with the data. Protocols are like a common language that allows devices all across the world to 
communicate with and understand each other.

Even though network protocols perform an essential function in network communication, security analysts should still understand 
their associated security implications. Some protocols have vulnerabilities that malicious actors exploit. For example, a 
nefarious actor could use the Domain Name System (DNS) protocol, which resolves web addresses to IP addresses, to divert traffic 
from a legitimate website to a malicious website containing malware. 

Three categories of network protocols:
Network protocols can be divided into three main categories: communication protocols, management protocols, and security 
protocols. There are dozens of different network protocols, but you don’t need to memorize all of them for an entry-level 
security analyst role. However, it’s important for you to know the ones listed in this reading. 

 Communication protocols:
 Communication protocols govern the exchange of information in network transmission. They dictate how the data is transmitted 
 between devices and the timing of the communication. They also include methods to recover data lost in transit. Here are a few 
 of them.

  ->Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is an internet communication protocol that allows two devices to form a connection and 
    stream data. TCP uses a three-way handshake process. First, the device sends a synchronize (SYN) request to a server. 
    Then the server responds with a SYN/ACK packet to acknowledge receipt of the device's request. Once the server receives the 
    final ACK packet from the device, a TCP connection is established. In the TCP/IP model, TCP occurs at the transport layer.

  ->User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is a connectionless protocol that does not establish a connection between devices before a 
    transmission. This makes it less reliable than TCP. But it also means that it works well for transmissions that need to get 
    to their destination quickly. For example, one use of UDP is for sending DNS requests to local DNS servers. In the TCP/IP 
    model, UDP occurs at the transport layer.

  ->Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application layer protocol that provides a method of communication between clients 
    and website servers. HTTP uses port 80. HTTP is considered insecure, so it is being replaced on most websites by a secure 
    version, called HTTPS that uses encryption from SSL/TLS for communication. However, there are still many websites that use 
    the insecure HTTP protocol. In the TCP/IP model, HTTP occurs at the application layer.

  ->Domain Name System (DNS) is a protocol that translates internet domain names into IP addresses. When a client computer wishes 
    to access a website domain using their internet browser, a query is sent to a dedicated DNS server. The DNS server then looks 
    up the IP address that corresponds to the website domain. DNS normally uses UDP on port 53. However, if the DNS reply to a 
    request is large, it will switch to using the TCP protocol. In the TCP/IP model, DNS occurs at the application layer.

 Management Protocols:
 The next category of network protocols is management protocols. Management protocols are used for monitoring and managing 
 activity on a network. They include protocols for error reporting and optimizing performance on the network.
 
  ->Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is a network protocol used for monitoring and managing devices on a network. 
    SNMP can reset a password on a network device or change its baseline configuration. It can also send requests to network 
    devices for a report on how much of the network’s bandwidth is being used up. In the TCP/IP model, SNMP occurs at the 
    application layer.

  ->Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) is an internet protocol used by devices to tell each other about data transmission 
    errors across the network. ICMP is used by a receiving device to send a report to the sending device about the data 
    transmission. ICMP is commonly used as a quick way to troubleshoot network connectivity and latency by issuing the “ping” 
    command on a Linux operating system. In the TCP/IP model, ICMP occurs at the internet layer.

 Security Protocols:
 Security protocols are network protocols that ensure that data is sent and received securely across a network. Security 
 protocols use encryption algorithms to protect data in transit. Below are some common security protocols.

  ->Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) is a network protocol that provides a secure method of communication between 
    clients and website servers. HTTPS is a secure version of HTTP that uses secure sockets layer/transport layer security 
    (SSL/TLS) encryption on all transmissions so that malicious actors cannot read the information contained. HTTPS uses port 443. 
    In the TCP/IP model, HTTPS occurs at the application layer.

  ->Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) is a secure protocol used to transfer files from one device to another over a network. 
    SFTP uses secure shell (SSH), typically through TCP port 22. SSH uses Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and other types of 
    encryption to ensure that unintended recipients cannot intercept the transmissions. In the TCP/IP model, SFTP occurs at the 
    application layer. SFTP is used often with cloud storage. Every time a user uploads or downloads a file from cloud storage, 
    the file is transferred using the SFTP protocol.

 Note: The encryption protocols mentioned do not conceal the source or destination IP address of network traffic. This means a 
       malicious actor can still learn some basic information about the network traffic if they intercept it. 

Network Address Translation:
The devices on your local home or office network each have a private IP address that they use to communicate directly with 
each other. However, in order for the devices with private IP addresses to communicate with the public internet, they need to 
have a single public IP address that represents all devices on the LAN to the public. For outgoing messages, the router can 
replace a private source IP address with its public IP address and perform the reverse operation for responses. This process is 
known as Network Address Translation (NAT) and it generally requires a router or firewall to be specifically configured to 
perform NAT. NAT is a part of layer 2 (internet layer) and layer 3 (transport layer) of the TCP/IP model.

Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol:
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is in the management family of network protocols. DHCP is an application layer 
protocol used on a network to configure devices. It works with the router to assign a unique IP address to each device and 
provide the addresses of the appropriate DNS server and default gateway for each device. DHCP servers operate on UDP port 67 
while DHCP clients operate on UDP port 68.

Address Resolution Protocol
By now, you are familiar with IP and MAC addresses. You’ve learned that each device on a network has a public IP address, a 
private IP address, and a MAC address that identify it on the network. A device’s IP address may change over time, but its MAC 
address is permanent because it is unique to a device's network interface card. The MAC address is used to communicate with 
devices within the same network, but sometimes, the MAC address is unknown. This is why the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is 
needed. ARP is mainly a network access layer protocol in the TCP/IP model used to translate the IP addresses that are found in 
data packets into the MAC address of the hardware device. 

Each device on the network performs ARP and keeps track of matching IP and MAC addresses in an ARP cache. ARP does not have a 
specific port number since it is a layer 2 protocol and port numbers are associated with the layer 7 application layer.
