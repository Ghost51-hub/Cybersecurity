Differences between Linux and SQL filtering:
Although both Linux and SQL allow you to filter through data, there are some differences that affect which one you should choose.

 Purpose:
 Linux filters data in the context of files and directories on a computer system. It’s used for tasks like searching for specific 
 files, manipulating file permissions, or managing processes. 

 SQL is used to filter data within a database management system. It’s used for querying and manipulating data stored in tables and 
 retrieving specific information based on defined criteria.
