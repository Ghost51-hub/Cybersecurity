Database:
An organized collection of information or data.

Spreadsheets:
 
 ->Designed for a single user or a small

 ->Store less data

Databases:

 ->Accessed by multiple people simultaneously

 ->Store massive amounts of data

 ->Perform complex tasks while accessing data

Relational database:
A structured database containing tables that are related to each other.

 Primary key: A column where every row has a unique entry. 

 Foreign key: A column in a table that is a primary key in another table.

SQL (Structure Query Language):
A programming language used to create, interact with, and request information from a database.

Query:
A request for data from a database table or a combination of tables.

Log:
A record of events that occur within an organization's systems.

Differences between Linux and SQL filtering:
Although both Linux and SQL allow you to filter through data, there are some differences that affect which one you should choose.

 Purpose:
 Linux filters data in the context of files and directories on a computer system. It’s used for tasks like searching for specific 
 files, manipulating file permissions, or managing processes. 

 SQL is used to filter data within a database management system. It’s used for querying and manipulating data stored in tables and 
 retrieving specific information based on defined criteria. 

 Syntax:
 Linux uses various commands and command-line options specific to each filtering tool. Syntax varies depending on the tool and 
 purpose. Some examples of Linux commands are find, sed, cut, e grep

 SQL uses the Structured Query Language (SQL), a standardized language with specific keywords and clauses for filtering data 
 across different SQL databases. Some examples of SQL keywords and clauses are WHERE, SELECT, JOIN.

 Structure:
 SQL offers a lot more structure than Linux, which is more free-form and not as tidy.

 For example, if you wanted to access a log of employee log-in attempts, SQL would have each record separated into columns. Linux 
 would print the data as a line of text without this organization. As a result, selecting a specific column to analyze would be 
 easier and more efficient in SQL.

 In terms of structure, SQL provides results that are more easily readable and that can be adjusted more quickly than when using 
 Linux.
